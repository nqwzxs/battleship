# Battleship

Battleship is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) written on HTML, CSS and JS using TDD with Jest.

Each player has a 10x10 board and 5 ships: Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine, and Patrol Boat. Players can place their ships by clicking on the board squares or randomly by clicking the "Randomize" button. The game is played in single player mode against a computer opponent with basic AI logic that enables it to attack adjacent squares around the hit ship's location.

Design of the game inspired by [elsaepo](https://github.com/elsaepo).
